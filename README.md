# Nspray

This is a simple raytracer for the TI-Nspire (only really tested with the CX II) that uses ndless and is written in Rust. By default, it renders a few spheres as well as a plane. A lot of the code is taken from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) because I'm too dumb to come up with it myself.
